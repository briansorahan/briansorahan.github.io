This post is about a particular decision that I made in the design of the [synthdef](http://doc.sccode.org/Classes/SynthDef.html)
representations for [sc](https://github.com/scgolang/sc). The particular decision under consideration is a great example of where
I felt like it was necessary to deviate from sclang to do something that made sense for Go.

Originally, I wanted the synthdef representations for sc to look as similar as possible to sclang's. As an example, we will
consider a simple synthdef written in sclang:

{% highlight javascript %}
SynthDef('simple', {
    Out.ar(0, SinOsc.ar(440));
});
{% endhighlight %}
