h2. Background

I used to work at a company that attempted to detect whether or not
a vehicle was moving from GPS data (lat/long).
I always thought that accelerometer data would be better for this
purpose, but never got to explore that idea while I worked there.
This post will contain the details of my personal exploration of
this idea. I am doing this purely because I am curious to see what
happens.
