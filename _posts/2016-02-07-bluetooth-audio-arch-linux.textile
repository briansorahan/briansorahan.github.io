<p>
My wife and I got an "iLive IKB333s":http://iliveelectronics.com/products/bluetooth/wireless-bluetooth-under-cabinet-music-system.html
under-cabinet bluetooth radio for Christmas this year and she said she wanted to be
able to stream audio from our Arch Linux laptop in the living room to it.
I decided to blog about what it was like to get this working because it's my first time
using bluetooth on Linux, and because it was successful.
</p>

<p>
TL;DR
The way I got this working was using "pulseaudio-bluetooth":https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=pulseaudio-bluetooth
(since we want to stream audio from Spotify, which uses pulse), and set the default sink to the bluetooth sink.
</p>

<p>
I had to steal the "USB dongle":http://www.amazon.com/JBtek-Raspberry-Bluetooth-4-0-adapter/dp/B00L08NCPQ/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top?ie=UTF8
that I bought for my raspberry pi to get bluetooth on my laptop (Toshiba Satellite L645).
After this I installed all the packages recommended "here":https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/bluetooth
and "here":https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Bluetooth_headset.
I added myself to the `lp` group since the bluetooth daemon will only give out bnep0 devices to users who are in this group.
</p>

<p>
After powering up the radio I set the source to Bluetooth, and hit the Pair button.
A blue light on the device starts blinking until you pair with it from another device.
</p>

<p>
Next I followed the "cli instructions":https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/bluetooth#Configuration_via_the_CLI
to connect to the radio.

```

<p>
Next I set the default pulseaudio sink to the bluetooth device

```
[brian@arch ~]$ pacmd list-sinks
2 sink(s) available.
* index: 0
       name: <alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1b.0.analog-stereo>
       ...
index: 1
       name: <bluez_sink.00_15_00_00_03_D9>
       ...
[brian@arch ~]$ pacmd set-default-sink 1
[brian@arch ~]$ pacmd list-sinks
2 sink(s) available.
index: 0
       name: <alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1b.0.analog-stereo>

       name: <bluez_sink.00_15_00_00_03_D9>

```
</p>

.h3 Conclusion
<p>
As always, the arch wiki was extremely helpful in getting bluetooth audio working.
